# CommonSense-Tasks

#### This repository organizes researches related to AI Technology Development for Commonsense Extraction, Reasoning, and Inference from Heterogeneous Data, especially CommonSense task.
#### This repository summarizes following researches.

## Research list
* Story Visualization by Online Text Augmentation with Context Memory (CMOTA) (ICCV 2023) - Daechul Ahn, Daneul Kim, Gwangmo Song, SeungHwan Kim, Dongyeop Kang, and Jonghyun Choi.

  * The proposed Context Memory and Online Text Augmentation (CMOTA), is a novel memory architecture for Bi-directional Transformers along with online text augmentation. This augmentation generates multiple pseudo-descriptions to provide additional supervision during training, enhancing the model's ability to generalize to language variations during inference.
